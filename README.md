# Data Type Converter  
The aim of this project is implementing a data type converter and becoming more familiar with bit-level representations of integers and floating point numbers.  
The apllication I implemented based on an assignment takes  
  • a file containing signed integers, unsigned integers and floating point numbers  
  • the byte ordering type (Little Endian or Big Endian),  
  • the size of the floating point data type (the size of both signed and unsigned integers are 2 bytes),  
as input and converts the contents of the file to hexadecimal according to the predefined format and gives the converted data as output.
